# Diabetes Detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This repository contains code and resources for building a diabetes detection model using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of health-related data of patients, including features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., along with the corresponding labels indicating whether the patient is diabetic or not.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `diabetes_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of diabetes detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes steps such as data loading, preprocessing, feature scaling using StandardScaler, model training using SVM, and evaluation of the trained model.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/GithubSemp-AI/diabetes-detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Run the `diabetes_detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to update the file paths if necessary.

4. Analyze the results, including the accuracy of the diabetes detection model.

## Results

The results of the diabetes detection can be found in the `diabetes_detection.ipynb` notebook. The evaluation includes the accuracy score, which indicates the performance of the SVM model in classifying diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for diabetes detection. By utilizing the provided code and dataset, researchers and practitioners can develop effective models to identify and predict diabetes based on patient health features.
